I'm a Software Engineer at Apple working under the Core Operating Systems org. I graduated Yale in 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I want to learn how systems of all types are designed and implemented, from computers to the brain.

I've been playing piano since elementary school and have recently started guitar. I arranged music for the Yale Precision Marching band as their Head Student Arranger. My [arrangements]({% link arrangements.markdown %}) ranged from Eastern and Western Pop Music, in addition to music from video games and anime.

<p>I've published some <a href="https://www.yalescientific.org/?s=%22matt+tu%22" target="_blank">articles</a> for the <a href="https://www.yalescientific.org/" target="_blank">Yale Scientific Magazine</a>, and I was their website manager until graduation.</p>

I'm also an avid [memer]({% link memes.markdown %}).

I grew up in Westchester County, New York, and now live in the Bay Area, California.

My Chinese name is《涂旭辰》which is a combination of my family name《涂》and a surname meaning《旭》rising sun +《辰》year of the dragon. I completed the <a href="https://light.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Light Fellowship</a> in Chinese during the Summer of 2020. I'm also learned Korean and hope to one day visit Korea.
