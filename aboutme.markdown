I'm a Yale '22 undergrad studying Computer Science. I want to learn how systems of all types are designed and implemented, from computers to the brain.

I've been playing piano since elementary school and have recently started guitar. I arrange music for the Yale Precision Marching band as their Head Student Arranger. My [arrangements]({% link arrangements.markdown %}) range from Eastern and Western Pop Music, in addition to music from video games and anime.

<p>I've published some <a href="https://www.yalescientific.org/?s=%22matt+tu%22" target="_blank">articles</a> for the <a href="https://www.yalescientific.org/" target="_blank">Yale Scientific Magazine</a>, and I am their current website manager.</p>

I'm also an avid [memer]({% link memes.markdown %}).

I live in Westchester County, New York.

My Chinese name is《涂旭辰》which is a combination of my family name《涂》and a surname meaning《旭》rising sun +《辰》year of the dragon. I completed the <a href="https://light.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Light Fellowship</a> in Chinese during the Summer of 2020. I'm also learning Korean and hope to study abroad in Korea before I graduate.
