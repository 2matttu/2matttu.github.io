I am a Yale undergrad student studying CS. I want to know how small things form a bigger thing.

I enjoy posting different types of memes in Facebook Groups.

I am also the Head STUDent Arranger for Yale's Marching Band. My arrangements range from Eastern and Western Pop Music, in addition to music from anime.
