I am a Yale undergrad student studying CS. I want to know how small things form a bigger thing.

I enjoy posting different types of [memes]({% link memes.markdown %}) in Facebook Groups.

I am also the Head STUDent Arranger for Yale's Marching Band. My [arrangements]({% link arrangements.markdown %}) range from Eastern and Western Pop Music, in addition to music from anime.

My Chinese name is《涂旭辰》which is a combination of my family name《涂》and a surname meaning《旭》rising sun +《辰》year of the dragon. I want to continue learning Chinese - my mother tongue, in addition to some Korean and Japanese before I graduate.
