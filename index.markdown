I am a Yale undergrad student studying CS. I want to know how small things form a more bigger, complex thing.

I am also the Head STUDent Arranger for Yale's Marching Band. My [arrangements]({% link arrangements.markdown %}) range from Eastern and Western Pop Music, in addition to music from anime.

I also enjoy posting different kinds of [memes]({% link memes.markdown %}) in various online groups.

I live in Westchester County, New York.
