I am a Yale undergraduate student studying CS. I want to know how small things form a bigger thing.

I enjoy posting different types of [memes]({% link memes.markdown %}) in Facebook Groups.

I am also the Head STUDent Arranger for Yale's Marching Band. My [arrangements]({% link arrangements.markdown %}) range from Eastern and Western Pop Music, in addition to music from anime.

I live in Westchester County, New York.
